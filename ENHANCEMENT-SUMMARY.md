- Persistence across editor sessions

## Performance Optimizations

The theme includes several optimizations to ensure good performance across devices:

### Hardware Detection

- CPU core detection to set appropriate default performance level
- Memory usage monitoring to prevent excessive resource consumption
- Battery status detection to conserve power when needed

### Rendering Optimizations

- CSS animations used instead of JavaScript where possible
- Hardware-accelerated animations with GPU hints
- Batched DOM updates to prevent layout thrashing
- RAF (requestAnimationFrame) for smooth animations

### Mobile Optimizations

- Automatic detection of mobile devices
- Reduced effect complexity on mobile platforms
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Battery-conscious operation

## Technical Implementation
The enhancements are implemented through:

1. **Theme-Specific Settings**: Each theme file includes custom settings that define its unique behavior

3. **Custom JavaScript Effects**: Dynamic visual effects implemented through JavaScript
4. **CSS Animations**: Custom animations for visual elements
5. **Sound Effects**: Subtle audio feedback for interactions

## Performance Considerations

- Effects automatically scale back on lower-performance devices

## Browser Compatibility

- Fallback behavior is provided for older browsers
- CSS animations degrade gracefully in unsupported environments

## Future Enhancements
- Continued refinement of existing effects
- Implementation for remaining themes (Gothic Raven, Gothic Amber Fog, etc.)

- Additional theme-specific sound effects
